# SND 2018 NYC Workshop: Advancing your HTML and CSS skills

As new CSS technologies emerge, editorial designers working on the web now have a pretty comprehensive set of tools to produce quality layout. In this workshop we will take a look into how some CSS tricks can advance your storytelling skills.

## Audience
Digital designers working in the editorial field or generally interested in layout and news.

**Prior knowledge:** basic Html and CSS.

## Expectations

This workshop will focus on small code snippets you can use to improve your digital designs. Because we won't be dealing with the maintenance of a large stylesheet system, we won't go over typical production code features such as:

* SASS, LESS, and other CSS extensions
* Prefixing
* Naming conventions
* ...?


## Draft

### Basic tricks
* Drop Caps (::first-letter)
* Quotes and optical alignment (negative indent)

* Scaling typography based on vw
* Highlight (with box-shadow)
* Positioning elements based on vh/vw â€” type over photography? I especially like these asymmetrical openings by Sandra Garcia:

* CSS column!
	* This is old, but underutilized! Nice example: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/21/magazine/voyages-issue-photographs-family-vacations-around-world.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/21/magazine/voyages-issue-photographs-family-vacations-around-world.html)
* vmin, vmax > maybe something with a square?
* Flexbox
	* Centering text vertically (!)
	* Some more layout stuff

### Maybe
* transform > translate/rotate? It's old, but underutilized imo:
	* [http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/dark-tourism/](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/dark-tourism/)
* object-fit and object-position?
	* [https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/)
	* [https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-position/](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-position/)
	* Maybe explain the advantage over having an img as background
* CSS Grid?
* position sticky?

### Hacks
* Aspect ratio: how to set up a fixed aspect ratio using padding bottom
